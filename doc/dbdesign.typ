= Introduction
The following is a specification for the database design for the RESONANZ
project.
Specifically, this specification is for the processed (segmented) audio data
and assumes that the source data has been split from its original format to
individual files separated by original speaker.
The method used to perform this segmentation is not covered in this document,
but will also be written down (at some point).

= Specification
Audio data is recorded from various speakers in laboratory, clinical, or
crowdsourced contexts.
The audio data is separated into _segments_.
A segment is a recording of speech consisting of only the voice of the speaker
in question.
//It must have a fixed duration, agreed upon in advanced and consistent across all segments from all speakers from all data sources.
Segments must have a duration in the range 4--12 seconds.
The recording need not only contain natural breakages or pauses in speech; in
other words, a speaker may be cut off or interrupted by the end of the file.

== Data labels
The mandatory labels (column names) for the database, as well as there shortened
key names, are as follows:
#set terms(tight: false, indent: 1em)

/ `db`: a descriptive name of the original context or experiment from which
  the data was taken.
/ `lang`: an ISO 639 two-letter language code (e.g., `de`, `en`) indicating
    the spoken language.
/ `pid`: a unique (to the `db`/database) numeric identifier, indiciating a
    specific speaker.
/ `snum`: a unique (to the `pid`/speaker) numeric identifier, indicating a
    specific audio segment.
/ `sex`: a single-letter code indicating the sex of the speaker; possible
    options are `m` (male), `f` (female), `d` (Divers), and `u` (unknown/not
    shared).
/ `phq-9`: nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score assessing the
  severity of depressive symptoms; must take on an integer value between 0 and
  27, inclusive (`phq-9` $in [0, 27]$); zero indicates the lowest severity.

== Optional data labels
/ `file_path`: a relative path to the segment file according to the scheme
  `./{db}/{pid}/{file_num}.<extension>`.
/ `gad-7`: Seven-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) score assessing the
  severy of generalized anxiety disorder; must take on an integer value between 0
  and 21, inclusive (`gad-7` $in [0, 21]$); zero indicates the lowest severity.

= Sample table
The database table will be stored as a `csv` file.

  [`qulab`], [`de`], [`n`], [`0001`], [`qulab/<n>/s0001.wav`], [`u`], [`12`], [`14`],
)
]

The `file_path` label is actually entirely unecessary, as it can be constructed
as a relative path according to the scheme `./{db}/{pid}/{file_num}.wav`; the
file extension must however be assumed.

However, it will be easier for everyone if the full file path is explicitly
included.
